This is the website we made to create a centralized platform that makes it easy for philanthropists to discover and support NGOs working in areas they are passionate about. 

We have used MERN(Mongo ds, Express, React js, Node js)  stack for approaching this problem. For front end we have used React js  which is a client-side JavaScript framework, for backend we have used node js which is a premier JavaScript web server and Express js, which is a Node.js web framework and finally used MongoDb as a database

As a result this web page covered most of the functionality listed in the Problems Statement that include information about their previous works, their end goal, and their plans as to how they can achieve their goal. 

We have also implemented Search and filter functionality which makes the Philanthropist job a bit easier. Also suggestion algorithms are used to categorise NGO's based on philanthropic needs. Also our webpage includes mechanisms for the users tocommunicate with different NGOs(text message, video meeting, etc.) using zegocloud

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is created with React

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
